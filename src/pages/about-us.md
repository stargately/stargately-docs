# About Us

Stargately is building Web3 infrastructures for new blockchains. Our current products are blockchain explorer, API and data analytics (https://blockroma.com/), double-entry bookkeeping app (https://beancount.io/), and we are also building an EVM-compatible crypto wallet and open to collaborations and partnerships.

We strive to be a challenger in SaaS tooling, leveraging best-in-class open source technology to speed up the software development and community building process. Stargately's mission is to warp the startup to the destination galaxy. Starting with double-entry bookkeeping software, Stargately applies cutting-edge innovations from the open-source community into startups, small businesses and online communities, enabling Internet applications and communities to be built with speed and quality.

## Who we are

We are an engineering team that builds mobile apps, SaaS/websites, Chrome extensions, backends, and data analysis services.

We are interested in open source technologies.

Core members are from Google, Facebook, Uber, and silicon valley startups.


## What we do

We engage community members in two categories:

| Categories |  |
| --- | --- |
| Core Developers | We are building community with open source software at [GitHub](https://github.com/stargately)  |
| Study Groups | We discuss [System Design and Architecture](https://github.com/puncsky/system-design-and-architecture) at 10x.pub |

## Community Culture

Think big and act on it
* Engineers build things anyway. Why not make them big?
* Bias toward action
* Build positive feedback loops
* Decompose and compose

Seek truth from facts
* Embrace radical transparency
* Input more and output more
* Deliberate practice and immediate feedback

Make magic
* Attention to detail
* Work long, smart, and hard to improve speed and quality
* Build 10x product with reusable frameworks, primitives, and processes

Extreme Ownership
* Success is in our own hands
* Sign our artwork
* Our success is symmetrical with our rewards

Customer Obsession
* Listen to our customers
* Be careful with root-level metrics
* We are representatives of our customers
* Make money to build better services, not the reverse
