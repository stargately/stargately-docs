## Culture Values

### Start with customers
The most honorable thing for an innovator is that your customers buy and recommend you. All this starts with understanding our customerâ€™s problems and then solving problems for them.

### Make magic for our times
Engineers and designers are not artists but skilled craftsmen dedicated to creating unique, innovative solutions that significantly impact and improve our current era or challenge the status quo of our times.

### Get creative and stand out
We believe that extraordinary products and services captivate people with their novelty and resonance. To make a lasting impression, we encourage a culture of innovative thinking and creative action.

### Prioritize view from the top
Originate, adopt, and broadcast big, bold ideas from the top of the information supply chain. 10x better output takes 10x better input.

### Bridge gaps, a lot
The market is fair and effective for most of the time. To outperform the market, we need to deep dive into industries, surface ourselves to transactions, and connect dots that are undiscoverable to local optimizers.

### Make relationships matter
We recognize the immense power and value in personal relationships. Each connection represents a unique bond that is invaluable. We are dedicated to cherishing, nurturing, and reciprocating the value in every interaction, ensuring that no relationship is ever taken for granted.

### Don't leave the world to jerks
Leaving the world to jerks would have significant negative consequences for humanity and our planet. Jerks often lack empathy, compassion, and a sense of social responsibility, which can result in disregarding the well-being of others and the environment.

### Small wins towards big bets
We motivate ourselves strongly with small wins all the time. We keep shipping new products and features every sprint. In general, we prioritize steady and sustainable growth over rapid yet potentially unsustainable expansion. While we're unafraid to make bold moves, we always do so with frugality and efficiency at the forefront.

### Learning as a Service
We place a strong emphasis on continuous learning, improvement, and knowledge sharing.
