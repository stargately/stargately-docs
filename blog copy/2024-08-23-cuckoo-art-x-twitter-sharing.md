"We're excited to offer our users a seamless way to share their Cuckoo Art creations with the world," said Lark Birdy, CEO of Cuckoo Network. "This feature not only amplifies our artists' voices but also introduces Cuckoo Art to potential new users through the power of social sharing."

The new sharing feature is now available to all Cuckoo Art users.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How does the X/Twitter sharing feature work?

A: After creating or viewing an artwork on Cuckoo Art, users will see a "Share to X" button. Clicking this button will open a pre-populated X/Twitter post with the artwork image and a link back to Cuckoo Art. Users can add their own text before posting.

### Q: Do I need to connect my X/Twitter account to Cuckoo Art?

A: No, the sharing feature uses X/Twitter's native sharing functionality, so you'll be prompted to log in to X/Twitter (if you're not already) when you click the share button.

### Q: What information is shared when I post to X/Twitter?

A: The post will include the image of the artwork, a link to view it on Cuckoo Art, and any additional text you choose to add. By default, it will also include the hashtag #CuckooArt.

### Q: Can I customize what's shared to X/Twitter?

A: Yes, you can edit the text of the post before sharing. However, the image and link to Cuckoo Art will always be included to maintain attribution.

### Q: Will sharing to X/Twitter affect my copyright or ownership of the artwork?

A: No, sharing to X/Twitter does not change your rights to the artwork. You retain all rights as defined in Cuckoo Art's terms of service.

### Q: Is there a limit to how many times I can share to X/Twitter?

A: There's no limit imposed by Cuckoo Art, but please be mindful of X/Twitter's posting guidelines to avoid any issues with their platform.

### Q: Can I share others' artworks or only my own?

A: You can share any public artwork on Cuckoo Art. When sharing another user's work, proper attribution will be included automatically.

### Q: Will this feature be available for other social media platforms in the future?

A: We're starting with X/Twitter integration, but we're exploring options to expand to other platforms based on user feedback and demand.

### Q: How does this benefit the Cuckoo Art community?

A: This feature increases exposure for our artists, potentially attracts new users to the platform, and helps build a stronger connection between Cuckoo Art and wider social media communities.

### Q: Is there any integration with meme ERC20 or ERC721 tokens when sharing to X/Twitter?

A: Currently, the sharing feature focuses on the artwork itself and doesn't directly integrate with blockchain tokens. However, we're exploring potential future features that could allow users to mint their Cuckoo Art creations as ERC721 NFTs or associate them with ERC20 meme tokens. These tokens could potentially be referenced or showcased when sharing to X/Twitter, adding an extra layer of blockchain integration and value to the shared content. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting possibility!
