## 3. **Bridge Stablecoins to Cuckoo Chain**

In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins play a crucial role by providing stability in an otherwise volatile market. We’re looking for talented blockchain developers to help us bridge stablecoins to the Cuckoo Chain, making our ecosystem more robust and versatile.

Your expertise could be the key to making Cuckoo Chain a more secure and reliable platform. Join us in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future.

## 4. **Build Cuckoo Pred Prediction Markets**

Prediction markets are an exciting area of DeFi that allows users to bet on the outcome of future events. We’re developing Cuckoo Pred, a prediction market on the Cuckoo Chain, and we need innovative thinkers to help bring this vision to life.

### What You’ll Gain:

- **Be a Pioneer:** Help shape one of the most dynamic and engaging aspects of the Cuckoo Network.
- **Challenge Yourself:** Dive into complex problems and come up with solutions that push the boundaries of what’s possible in prediction markets.
- **Community Impact:** Create a platform where users can speculate, hedge risks, and participate in a decentralized market with real-world outcomes.
