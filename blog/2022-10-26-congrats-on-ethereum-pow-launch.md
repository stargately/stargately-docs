We're glad to see Blockroma for EthereumPow mainnet is up and running smoothly for the last month! As a result, we are closing the support for its testnet.

What is a Testnet? A testnet is a temporary blockchain that is used for testing purposes. It allows developers to experiment with new features or applications without having to worry about losing real ETHW tokens.

We're closing the support for EthereumPow's testnet because the mainnet is now up and running smoothly. We want to thank all of our customers who supported us during this transition.

What's Next? Now that the Blockroma explorer for the EthereumPow mainnet is up and running, we'll be focusing on adding new features and improving the overall experience for our users. Stay tuned for more updates!
